## Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions & Answers

**Q: What datasets are you actually using?**
> A: We've integrated five major sources: INPE's Earth observation catalog, Canadian Wildfire data, TESS space telescope archive, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Currently using sample tile sources for demo, but the architecture supports real NASA data integration.

**Q: How do you handle such large images?**
> A: We use OpenSeadragon, which implements Deep Zoom technology. Images are divided into tiles at multiple zoom levels, loading only what's visible. This allows smooth exploration of gigabyte-sized images.

**Q: Can users save their work?**
> A: Yes! Users can save labels, capture views, and export analysis data. We use browser storage for session management and plan to add cloud sync in future versions.

**Q: Is this open source?**
> A: Yes, under MIT license. We encourage contributions and want this to be a community-driven project.

**Q: How does the comparison tool detect changes?**
> A: Currently using pixel-based comparison algorithms. We plan to integrate machine learning for more sophisticated change detection in future versions.

**Q: Can this work offline?**
> A: The core functionality requires internet for loading images, but we're exploring progressive web app features for offline capability.

**Q: What about mobile devices?**
> A: The web app is responsive and works on tablets and phones. We're also planning native mobile apps for iOS and Android.

**Q: How accurate is the feature search?**
> A: We use a curated database of known features with precise coordinates. Users can also add their own labels, building a collaborative knowledge base.
